#This parameter determine whether the cost map need to shutdown when move_base in inactive state
shutdown_costmaps: false

#The rate at which move base run the update loop and send the velocity commands
controller_frequency: 5.0

#Controller wait time for a valid command before a space-clearing operations
controller_patience: 3.0

#The rate at which the global planning loop is running, if it is 0, planner only plan when a new goal is received
planner_frequency: 1.0

#Planner wait time for finding a valid path befire the space-clearing operations
planner_patience: 5.0

#Time allowed for oscillation before starting robot recovery operations
oscillation_timeout: 10.0

#Distance that robot should move to be considered which not be oscillating. Moving above this distance will reset the oscillation_ timeout
oscillation_distance: 0.2

# local planner - default is trajectory rollout
base_local_planner: "dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS"
